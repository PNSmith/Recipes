## Ingredients

* 500g plain flour
* 300g unsalted butter, cubed and chilled
* 50ml white wine vinegar
* 100ml water
* 2 tbsp granulated sugar (if youâ€™re using the crust for something sweet)
* 5g salt

## Method

1. Mix the water, vinegar and sugar in a measuring jug and allow the sugar to disolve.
2. Add the flour, and salt to a bowl or food processor and mix.
2. Add the cubed butter and mix until it is incorporated and the mixture is the texture of sand.
3. Add the liquid, and mix until it all comes together into a dough. (add a little more water if dough is to dry)
3. Tip the contents onto a piece of plastic wrap. Use the plastic wrap to shape the dough into a puck shape, and chill it in the refrigerator for at least half an hour.
4. At the end of that time, remove the dough from the refrigerator, and on a lightly floured board, roll it into a circle about an inch wider than your pie pan.
5. Lay it into the pan, pressing it into the corners so that it fits snugly. Use a fork to perforate the bottom, trim the overhanging dough to half an inch, and then refrigerate for at least half an hour before filling.
